# cis_115_fundamentals_of_programming_cpp_v02

This is a public repo for:

Students of Nick Schoeb enrolled at Harford Community College in CIS 115 Fundamentals of Programming.

This is primarily intended as another way to access code samples used in the course.

Note to students, this should make it easier to read and copy lecture code samples than the format provided in the LMS. I also intend to leave this up as long as possible so you can reference it long after you leave the course.

These are examples in C/C++ as part of a course focused on learning the fundamentals of programming. They are not necessarily intended to reflect any style of, era of, or even be definitive examples of C/C++ programming. They are simply a generic use of C/C++ used to teach basic ideas and skills needed across most programming languages.

These examples are currently geared towards using Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition and the MSVC compiler. Most examples here are simple enough they can be easily adjusted to work with other IDEs and compilers.

For a more detailed version of this for other instructors, an open educational resource (OER) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources version is in process. That version will have more details on delivering this course as well as additional resources available for instructors only. That version will be labeled version 3 when available.

Note that the contributions herein are the work of Nick Schoeb and/or Mark Dencler.
